All other projects I found was a connection to Web sites, but the link was dropped after the connection.\r\nI added the ability to keep the connection open, but I didn't tried to connect to WEB pages (I don't need it).\r\n\r\n##About the ENC28J60\r\nENC28J60 Ethernet Module utilizes the new Microchip ENC28J60 Stand-Alone Ethernet Controller IC featuring a host of features to handle most of the network protocol requirements. The board connects directly to most microcontrollers with a standard SPI interface with a transfer speed of up to 20MHz.\r\n\r\n##What we have?\r\n**We can do the following:**\r\n\r\n1. Open socket connection to socket server from arduino.\r\n2. Send UDP packets\r\n3. Listen to UDP.\r\n4. Get NTP.\r\n5. Connect with DHCP.\r\n6. Connect to server with DNS name.\r\n\r\n##How to use\r\n###Set the ethernet you need to set MAC address:\r\n`static uint8_t mymac[6] = {0x54,0x55,0x58,0x10,0x00,0x24};`\r\n\r\n###Set the socket:\r\n`static uint16_t my_port = 11200;     // client port`\r\n\r\n`static uint16_t server_port = 1000;   // server port`\r\n\r\n`static uint8_t dest_ip[4]={192,168,1,105};  //server IP`\r\n\r\n###Start socket - in setup\r\n`net.socketSetup(tcpSerialPrint,my_port,dest_ip,server_port);`\r\n> the _tcpSerialPrint_ is callback function on receiving data.\r\n\r\n`while (!net.connect()) {}`\r\n\r\n`Serial.println(\"socket connected\");`\r\n\r\n### keep the socket alive - in the loop\r\n`net.process();`\r\n\r\n`net.available()`\r\n\r\n\r\n##Next steps\r\n1. Add the ability to connect web sits.\r\n2. keep alive connection.\r\n3. Re-transmission packets.\r\n4. Connect to network with static address.\r\n\r\n##Authors and Contributors - Thank you\r\nTo create this, I had help from the following:\r\n* [ethercard](https://github.com/jcw/ethercard) - Jean-Claude Wippler\r\n* [Arduino 1.0 with enc28j60 Ethernet Shield V1.1](http://trollmaker.com/article11/arduino-1-0-with-enc28j60-ethernet-shield-v1-1) - Virtualmix\r\n*   The help to understand [Arduino Goodness : Ethernet Shield](http://www.codetorment.com/2009/10/24/arduino-goodness-ethernet-shield/#postcomment) - Tom Decreton","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
