Socket-network-for-enc28j60---arduino
=====================================

The TCP socket connection based on enc28j60 chip for arduino 1.0
You have the following abilities:
 - Open socket connection to server from arduino.
 - send UDP packets
 - Listen to UDP.
 - Get NTP.
 - connect with DHCP.
 - connect to server with DNS name.
I used ethercard and ethershiled libraries to create the socket project.
